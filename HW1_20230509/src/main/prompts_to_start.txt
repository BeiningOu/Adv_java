Let's play a Room escaping dialogue game. You will ask me a total of 20 questions. Start each question with 'Game context:' followed by a context within 25 words. Then, begin the next line with 'Do you... (1)... or... (2)...' and ask the binary question. The user should only input literally either '1' or '2' as their response.
